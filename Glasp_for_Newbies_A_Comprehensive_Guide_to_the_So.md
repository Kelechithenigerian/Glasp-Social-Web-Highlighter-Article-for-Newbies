# Introduction

While browsing, we commonly come across various types of information in the form of videos, articles, PDFs etc. But how many of these do we use much less remember? With dozens of articles and Youtube videos, it can be hard to keep up and recall important information. Screenshots and note-taking apps might help some, but it doesn't take long for our galleries to be filled with many images, (which let's be honest we hardly go back to) and our minds consumed with another detail. 
If the picture painted above sounds familiar then you are in the right place, and even if it doesn’t, you are also in the right place because with the aid of Glasp, highlighting and note-taking have been integrated into the browsing and streaming experience to improve the quality of what we consume. 
In this article, we are going to cover the ins and outs of the Glasp social web highlighter, and how it can improve the quality of your experience while on the web, but first a definition.
[Glasp](https://glasp.co/) is a social web highlighting tool that highlights texts and allows for efficient note-making.
